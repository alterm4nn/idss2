# IDSSv2

This project is simple password change application. It's intended for LDAP-based systems where users for whatever reasons don't have access to built-in password change services.

Originally, this project is created to support my further learning of .NET Core technology.

## Installation

Installation and configuration tutorials will be added later.

## Why v2?
V1 was created long time ago for one specific organization. Now, I would like to change architecture of the solution and write it from scratch on new framework version.
